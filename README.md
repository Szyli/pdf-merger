# Introduction
This is my personal project to make a *ready to be executed* program that concatenates given pdf files. The program is built upon python with `customTkinter` and the `PyPDF2` packages.

> [!Note]
> The current version is not coomplete but may be run if you have python with the necessary packages installed.
> In addition, I work on a windows system and thus cannot ensure smooth operation with others (although I am quite sure there wouldn't be any problem).

# TODO list

- [ ] Implement file order switching in app after selecting files
- [ ] Implement the option to specify pages of the selected files to merge
- [ ] Finally, turn the program into a simply executable `.exe` file for everyday users

# Background
This project idea was born when, as a physicist, I had to merge the sections of books into one large pdf file.
Later on I come to need this quick python code more and more but it was not comfortable enough.
Therefore, I worked on this simple app with a similarly simple role.
This program is absolutely **local** and does not require any internet connection!
Just a friend in the modern life.
